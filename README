***** SDL Genesis Project *****
*******************************
Jun 2011



This is my first project using SDL and GIT.

The main objective of this project is to learn about SDL, learn how to use GIT and remember what I forgot about C++.


Initially I will follow the great tutorial of Lazy Foo (Link below).
Next I will make a little clone of a simple game. Not decided what game for now.

Maybe in the future I'll make an original game with everything that I learned.


Learning is a good thing. ;)
